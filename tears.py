tears - Flask SQLAlchemy single connection extension to run tests
        in a super transaction and rollback at teardown.

__version__ = '0.1'


class SQLAlchemy(FlaskSQLAlchemy):
    """
       This SQLAlchemy class uses an unique connection with an external
       transaction (see: http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/orm/session.html
                         #joining-a-session-into-an-external-transaction)

       It overrides the `get_engine` method to return the connection instead
       of the engine in order to prevent other connections creation.

       It exposes two methods:
          `setup` which creates a new external transaction
          `teardown` which rollbacks the external transaction

       This MUST be used only in testing environment for obvious reasons.
       A common pattern would be:
       ````
          if testing:
              from tears import SQLAlchemy
          else:
              from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
       ````

       and in tests:
       ````
           def setUp():
               app.db.setup()

           def tearDown():
               app.db.teardown()
       ````
       """

            engine = super(SQLAlchemy, self).get_engine(app, bind)
            self._tears_connection = engine.connect()

            # Apparently we cannot use sane row count in this case:
            self._tears_connection.dialect.supports_sane_rowcount = False

            # Start a transaction in case of

        return self._tears_connection

    def setup(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """If there is an ongoing connection roll it back"""

        if self._tears_transaction:
            self._tears_transaction.rollback()

        # Start a new transaction inside the connection
        self._tears_transaction = self._tears_connection.begin()

    def teardown(self, *args, **kwargs):
